# ESP32 Alarm Clock

This project is to create an alarm clock using the following components:
- [esp32 thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13907) - I used this because the clock needs to run on battery and this has an integrated charging circuit and connector for a LiPol battery
- [ds3231 RTC module](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SODIAL-DS3231-AT24C32-Precision-Arduino/dp/B00K67X496/)
- [ssd1306 OLED display](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SODIAL-DS3231-AT24C32-Precision-Arduino/dp/B00K67X496/)
- [ky-040 rotary encoder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SODIAL-DS3231-AT24C32-Precision-Arduino/dp/B00K67X496/)

The project uses the following schematic
